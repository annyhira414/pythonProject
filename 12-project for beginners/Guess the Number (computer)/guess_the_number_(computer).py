import random


# print(random.randint(1 , 6))
# normal way, but now we are using a function

def guess(x):
    my_random_number = random.randint(1, x)

'''
2nd steps - ones is done then the computer has a random number , we need to guess the random number .
we need to use input and the computer will  tell us whether its too high oe too low ,
or if i guess the number then computer say the number is correctly. 
so I need to keep looping until I get the right answer
